I created a page for the user and tried to create a admin page as well.

User Side

Run/open the default file to view the website as a user

Admin side

Run/open the Category file. Only the category and dashboard file work here.

The database is not connected, I did however try and create tables that i though I could use.
This can be viewed by the SQL file.
